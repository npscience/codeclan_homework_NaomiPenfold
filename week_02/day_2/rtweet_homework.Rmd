# Learning Objectives 

Be able to explore and wrangle an unseen dataset so as to answer specific questions

# Introduction

Social media is everywhere, and the ability to analyse data from it is invaluable. If you want to scrape data from Twitter yourself, you can use the `rtweet` package. All that is needed is a Twitter account, and you are good to go. 
<center>
![](http://www.storybench.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rtweet-730x461.png)
</center>

In this case, we have used the `rtweet` package to download 500 tweets from the [@CodeClanScot twitter page](https://twitter.com/CodeClanScot). 
  
In this homework, you will be working with data downloaded from the CodeClan Twitter page, to do some analysis of overall tweet metrics (likes and retweets), as well as some analysis of the tweet and hashtag content. You'll also be working with the strings contained within variables. 
<br>
The overall goal of the homework is to practice everything you've learnt this week on an entirely new dataset. 
<br>

<br>

# MVP 

<br>

**Question 1.**  
Load the `code_clan_tweets.csv` data. Find the number of rows, columns, and list all the variable names. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
tweets <- read_csv("data/code_clan_tweets.csv")
view(tweets)
dim(tweets) # 234 rows, 27 columns
names(tweets) # variable names
```

<br>

**Question 2.**  
Find the total number of favourites (stored in `favorite_count`) that CodeClan tweets have got. Don't add a tweet's `favorite_count` to the total when the tweet was quoted (see the `is_quote` variable). 

```{r}
# check for NAs
tweets %>% 
  summarise(across(.cols = everything(),
                   .fns = ~ sum(is.na(.x))))

# Many cols with NAs in - check this table when using columns below

# Find sum of favorites for non-quoted tweets:
tweets %>% 
  group_by(is_quote) %>%  
  summarise(sum = sum(favorite_count)) %>%  # 425 (in FALSE), note: 0 NAs in favorite_count
  filter(is_quote == FALSE) %>% 
  pull(sum) # 425

# alternative way
tweets %>% 
  filter(is_quote == FALSE) %>% # down to 227 rows (note: 0 NAs in is_quote)
  select(favorite_count) %>% # reduce to one col
  pull() %>% # reduce to a vector
  sum() # 425

# Answer: 425 favorites in total, across 227 non-quoted tweets
```

<br>

**Question 3.**  
Summarise the mean number of retweets (`retweet_count`), split by the type of platform that was used to tweet (`source`). Again, omit quoted tweets from the mean.

```{r}
# note 0 NAs in retweet_count (from above)

tweets %>% 
  filter(is_quote == FALSE) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(retweet_count)) %>% 
  pull() 

# Mean retweets of non-quoted tweets = 2.57...
```

### homework review
Read the question! Split by source...

```{r}
tweets %>% 
  filter(is_quote == FALSE) %>%
  group_by(source) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(retweet_count))
```


<br>

**Question 4.**  
Count the total number of likes (i.e. total of `favorite_count`), split by `media` type, and arrange them from most likes to least. Assume that any tweets without a listed `media` type are of type "text".  

```{r}
# 145 NAs in media_type (as per above) - recode as "text" before summarising

tweets %>% 
  mutate(media_type = case_when( ## review: use coalesce to change NAs!
    is.na(media_type) == TRUE ~ "text",
    TRUE ~ media_type)) %>% 
  group_by(media_type) %>% 
  summarise(num_tweets = n(),
            total_likes = sum(favorite_count)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total_likes))

# photos: 371 likes across 89 tweets, text: 75 likes across 145 tweets
# tweets with photos in tend get more likes!
```

<br>

**Question 5.**  
Find the mean number of characters that a CodeClan tweet contains.  You can either find a way to count the text in the `text` variable, or use the variable `display_text_width` which contains a count. Checking both would be a good idea if possible to see if they match (but it's not essential).  

```{r}
# First, inspect display_text_width to check if suitable
# show the 15 smallest values
tweets %>% 
  select(text, display_text_width) %>% 
  slice_min(display_text_width, n = 15)
# note display_text_width seems to discount mentions "@name" (which makes sense)

# show the 15 highest values (expect twitter chr limit: 240)
tweets %>% 
  select(text, display_text_width) %>% 
  slice_max(display_text_width, n = 15) # 281-261
# inspection suggests no missing values to correct, and 0 NAs (as above)
# display_text_width seems sensible to use

# Approach 1: find the mean using display_text_width

tweets %>% 
  select(display_text_width) %>% 
  summarise(ave_length = mean(display_text_width)) %>% 
  pull() # mean length is 149.42 characters

# Approach 2: find the mean by first counting characters in text column

tweets %>% # first use nchar() to make new column with num characters in text
  mutate(nchar = nchar(text), .after = text) %>% # hw review: used str_length(), same answers
  select(nchar) %>% 
  summarise(ave_length = mean(nchar)) %>% 
  pull() # mean length is 188.3718

# Note: approach 2 mean > approach 1 mean

# nchar counts look to be higher than display_text_width, i.e. includes mentions (@name)
# check: is nchar > display_text_width for all rows?

# remake nchar col for test
tweets %>% # first use nchar() to make new column with num characters in text
  mutate(nchar = nchar(text), .after = text) %>% 
  mutate(nchar_larger = if_else(
    nchar > display_text_width, TRUE, FALSE),
    .after = display_text_width) %>%
  count(nchar_larger) # 47 FALSE + 187 TRUE
# so it's not consistently higher if counting chrs in text vs using display_text_width
# something else is going on, not investigating further here
```

<br>

**Question 6.**  
The `code_clan_info.csv` data file contains `status_url` along with other info. Load this in, and join it to the `code_clan_tweets` tibble, so that you have a `status_url` for each tweet. Decide which variable to join the tibbles on.  

```{r}
codeclan_info <- read_csv("data/code_clan_info.csv")

view(codeclan_info)
glimpse(codeclan_info) # 234 obs x 15 variables

# Note: account_created_at date values are tpye <chr> not date; 
# Note: location contains multiple answers (may not be an issue)
```
```{r}
# Keys: both codeclan_info & tweets df's have PK: tweet_id

# Join 'status_url' from codeclan_info to tweets df using 'tweet_id'
left_join(tweets, codeclan_info, by = "tweet_id") # 234 obs x 41 variables

# Approach 2: first reduce cols to join from codeclan_info to just id and status_url
tweets_w_status <- codeclan_info %>% # save this join for Q7
  select(tweet_id, status_url) %>% 
  left_join(tweets, codeclan_info, by = "tweet_id") # 234 obs x 28 variables (+1 var from original tweets)
tweets_w_status 


```

<br>

**Question 7.**  
From your new joined data, create a new tibble `codeclan_hashtags` containing only `tweet_id` and `hashtags`, then convert `hashtags` into lowercase for analysis. Keep only those tweets with hashtags.

```{r}
codeclan_hashtags <- tweets_w_status %>% # assign to new df
  select(tweet_id, hashtags) %>% # select only id and hashtags
  mutate(hashtags = str_to_lower(hashtags)) %>% # convert hashtags to lowercase
  drop_na(hashtags) # remove NAs in hashtags -> from 234 to 117 obs
codeclan_hashtags
```

## Homework review summary

* to replace NA with something else, use coalesce()
* make sure I've read the Q & answered in full
* str_length() is alternative to nchar() for counting characters
* extension answers make sense


# Extensions

<br>

**Question 8.**  
Some tweets have more than one hashtag, denoted by the `c(` symbols at the start of the string. Use the `str_sub()` and `str_detect()` functions and your `codeclan_hashtags` tibble from above to find all the cases in which the hashtag string begins with characters`c(`.
<details>
<summary>**Hint**</summary>
Try a regex pattern `"c\\("`. The double backslash is necessary in R to mark a backslash as itself being escaped. 
</details>

<br>

**Question 9.**  
Use the `str_detect()` function to find all tweets with `text` that mentions "Edinburgh", and count how many such tweets there are. 
<details>
<summary>**Hint**</summary>
You may need to make sure your tweets are all the same case before searching.
</details>

<br>

**Question 10.**  
Use `str_extract_all()` with a regular expression to find out which Twitter users CodeClan have been tweeting. 
<details>
<summary>**Hint**</summary>
Think about all the different characters which could be in a Twitter username, do a bit of online research
