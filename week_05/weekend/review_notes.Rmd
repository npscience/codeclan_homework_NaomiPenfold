* For colour palette, instead of polychrome, try colourRampPalette for more colours
* too many red ticks, could I reduce options?

From Thijmen's app:

* Plotly is nice for interactive labels
* selectInput dropdown lists - you can type a text string to filter the options available

From Weezay's app:

* the shiny dashboard package has info boxes that return values from data as an output

Justyna Q:

* to get a plot that always shows "total sales over time" but you can select additional lines to show sales by an input (e.g. developer), try plotly:
  * with logic (e.g. if nintendo, p + nintendo),
  * or wrap plot in ggplotly(plot) and clicking on legend items turns things on/off
  
We won't cover plotly in course, so for more info, see https://plotly.com/r/.
